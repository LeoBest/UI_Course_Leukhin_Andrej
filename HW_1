I'd like to have hat number 3 (an artist) for start of career because it unite prewius 2 hats.
Engineer hat responsible to find elegend solution and antropologes hat responsible for usibility.
And pridge between those hats is artist.But on my opinion to became professional Front-end engineer
we should have all hats in our cupboard)
